## My process
I started with the background colour, made the card "container", then I put the picture, made a div under that with the contents inside of it, for the music button sections I made another div and used display: flex, align-items: center; to center the options. 
Then I did the buttons on the bottom, left it for about 4 months, and came back to it finished the final touch ups, did the desktop design, and finished the project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I learned a lot on this challenge, I got more of an understanding on how to layers boxes on top of eachother to make a card, and the mobile-first method I found it easier when growing the box.
